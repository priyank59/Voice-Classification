Problem Statement: Motion Studios is the largest radio production house in Europe. Its total revenue is $
1B+. The company has launched a new reality show "The Star RJ." The show is about finding a new radio jockey
who will be the star presenter on upcoming shows.
In the first round, participants have to upload their voice clip online. The clip will be evaluated by experts for
selection to the next round. There is a separate team in the first round for evaluation of male and female
voice.
Response to the show is unprecedented, and company is flooded with voice clips.
You “as an ML” expert have to classify the voice as either male or female so that the first level of filtration is
quicker.
